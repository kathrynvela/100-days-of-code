# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some HTML review on my Udemy course (The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** This was admittedly a super easy day - I learned all this stuff a few months ago, but since I took a break for pretty much all of December, I decided it couldn't hurt to refresh on the basics. 


### Day 2: January 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked though more HTML review and installed some packages for Atom. 

**Thoughts**: More of the same today. I'm excited to play with these new packages, especially the atom-beautify one.


### Day 3: January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo! Continued working on HTML in my Udemy course. 

**Thoughts**: Github still isn't very intuitive for me, but I'm getting better with practice. 

### Day 4: January 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Published my first project from this Udemy course, a professional CV website with pure HTML, using GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**: I've used GitHub Pages before, but this is the first time I've felt comfortable doing it. It's also the first time I've uploaded multiple webpages for one website!

### Day 5: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 6: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 7: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. I finished the introductory CSS portion and moved on to the intermediate part of the course.

**Thoughts**: Even though I'm still reviewing stuff I learned last year, I'm learning new things almost every day. Today, it was that the little icon that shows up in the tab of a webpage is called a "favicon" :)

### Day 8: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. Focused on positioning today, which has been a struggle for me from the very beginning.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad I'm revieiwng this part again, I always struggle with positioning, especially centering. I had to laugh when I saw that section was titled "The dark art of centering elements with CSS" lol

### Day 9: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. Learned some cool stuff about fonts, and I'm planning to revist typography once I finish the main part of this course.

**Thoughts**: As much as I enjoy the coding part of web development, I find myself more interested in the design aspect - colors, fonts, layouts, etc. I think I'll need to take a design course after this one!

### Day 10: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Intermediate CSS portion of my Udemy course by adding the finishing touches to my personal (practice) website!

**Thoughts**: Learned about button generators in this lesson and wow that is cool!
