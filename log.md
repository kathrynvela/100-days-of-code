<h1>100 Days of Code with Kathryn Vela</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey! I am a librarian by training and started learning how to code so I can create resources that help connect people to the information they need.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find a log of my coding activities and projects.</p>

<h2 align="center">Day 1: January 06, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some HTML review on my Udemy course (The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** This was admittedly a super easy day - I learned all this stuff a few months ago, but since I took a break for pretty much all of December, I decided it couldn't hurt to refresh on the basics.

<h2 align="center">Day 2: January 07, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Worked though more HTML review and installed some packages for Atom. 

**Thoughts**: More of the same today. I'm excited to play with these new packages, especially the atom-beautify one.

<h2 align="center">Day 3: January 08, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo! Continued working on HTML in my Udemy course. 

**Thoughts**: Github still isn't very intuitive for me, but I'm getting better with practice.

<h2 align="center">Day 4: January 09, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Published my first project from this Udemy course, a professional CV website with pure HTML, using GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**: I've used GitHub Pages before, but this is the first time I've felt comfortable doing it. It's also the first time I've uploaded multiple webpages for one website!

<h2 align="center">Day 7: January 12, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. I finished the introductory CSS portion and moved on to the intermediate part of the course.

**Thoughts**: Even though I'm still reviewing stuff I learned last year, I'm learning new things almost every day. Today, it was that the little icon that shows up in the tab of a webpage is called a "favicon" :)

<h2 align="center">Day 8: January 13, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. Focused on positioning today, which has been a struggle for me from the very beginning.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad I'm revieiwng this part again, I always struggle with positioning, especially centering. I had to laugh when I saw that section was titled "The dark art of centering elements with CSS" lol

<h2 align="center">Day 9: January 14, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review on my Udemy course. Learned some cool stuff about fonts, and I'm planning to revist typography once I finish the main part of this course.

**Thoughts**: As much as I enjoy the coding part of web development, I find myself more interested in the design aspect - colors, fonts, layouts, etc. I think I'll need to take a design course after this one!

<h2 align="center">Day 10: January 15, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Intermediate CSS portion of my Udemy course by adding the finishing touches to my personal (practice) website!

**Thoughts**: Learned about button generators in this lesson and wow that is cool!

<h2 align="center">Day 11: January 16, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Bootstrap 4 today and created a new practice website.

**Thoughts**: I'm really excited to learn how to lay out webpages with Bootstrap!

<h2 align="center">Day 12: January 17, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use Bootstrap columns to lay out my website. 

**Thoughts**: Now I know how to use CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and Bootstrap columns to lay out webpages; I'm wondering if there are guidelines about which approach to use in different circumstances, or if it's just a matter of preference.

<h2 align="center">Day 13: January 18, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Woke up early to finish my hour of code before the weekend took over - formatted buttons with Bootstrap and learned about Font Awesome.

**Thoughts**: I'm loving Bootstrap so far; the documentation makes it really easy to use.

<h2 align="center">Day 14: January 19, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Added a carousel feature to my practice website with Bootstrap

**Thoughts**: This was a little more complex than the Bootstrap I've learned so far, but it's a cool effect and I'm glad we covered it in this course.

<h2 align="center">Day 15: January 20, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learned about media queries and using them to make webpages more responsive.

**Thoughts**: As someone interested in accessibility, media queries were very cool to learn about.

<h2 align="center">Day 16: January 21, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: After learning about the z-index yesterday, I put it into practice today on my practice app website. 

**Thoughts**: I'll definitely need more practice on stacking order, I'd like to be able to intuitively understand what I need to code instead of trying things out haphazardly.

<h2 align="center">Day 17: January 22, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to refactor my code, focusing on readability and modularity.

**Thoughts**: The organizer in me loves tidying up my code!

<h2 align="center">Day 18: January 23, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: I finished my practice website for an app through my Udemy course, and I'm getting ready to dive into Javascript!

**Thoughts**: I love how this website turned out, I learned so many cool things as I put it together.

<h2 align="center">Day 19: January 24, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: I decided to take a break from my Udemy course and work on getting my Responsive Web Design certification from free CodeCamp. I already finished one project!

**Thoughts**: It's interesting to have to meet certain requirements - I'd much rather use Bootstrap or Grid to complete these projects, but I need to make sure I include certain elements.  

**Link to Tweet**: KathrynVela31 Day 19


<h2 align="center">Day 20: January 25, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on freeCodeCamp projects, this time the product landing page.

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to make sure I design an actually good-looking website, instead of just fulfilling the basic requirements. It adds some extra time, but I think it will be worth it.  

**Link to Tweet**: KathrynVela31 Day 20


<h2 align="center">Day 21: January 26, 2020</h2>

**Today's Progress**: I finished the product landing page project for my Responsive Design Certification from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I definitely would have just used Bootstrap to put this whole thing together if I didn't have to fulfill the challenge requirements, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

**Today's Progress**: Finished another challenge for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Design Certification. One more to go!

**Thoughts**: I was able to use Bootstrap for this project, and that was a lot of fun. I'm especially proud I got the screen size changes right.

<h2 align="center">Day 24: January 29, 2020</h2>

<imc src="#" alt="">

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from Udemy and freeCodeCamp to watch a 1-hour design course on Scrimba.

**Thoughts**: So much of design is subjective, but it's nice to have a review of the basic principles.

<h2 align="center">Day 25: January 30, 2020</h2>

<imc src="#" alt="">

**Today's Progress**: More Scrimba design course today.

**Thoughts**: Most of these principles seem to match what I've been doing so far, which is gratifying. I still struggle a bit with matching fonts together, but I found out Google Fonts offers suggestions, which will be a huge help.

<imc src="#" alt="">

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Scrimba design course today. 

**Thoughts**: This was a fun break/review of CSS. I've been avoiding a deep dive into Javascript, but I think I'm ready to get back into my Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: A lot of this is review so far, but I appreciate the opportunity to refresh my memory and refine my skills.

<h2 align="center">Day 28: February 02, 2020</h2>

<imc src="#" alt="">

**Today's Progress**: Learned about strings and numbers in Javascript today. 

**Thoughts**: These exercises all make sense right now, and I'm hoping they still make sense once I start applying them to projects.

<h2 align="center">Day 29: February 03, 2020</h2>

<imc src="#" alt="">

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introductory Javascript modules, which included functions.

**Thoughts**: I feel mildly confident in my Javascript skills at the moment, but I haven't really tested them yet, so we'll see how the next few modules go.

**Today's Progress**: More work learning DOM. 

**Thoughts**: DOM seems simple enough, I'm just wondering if it seems that way because I'm learning beginner stuff or if it really is easy to understand.

**Today's Progress**: I worked thorugh the rest of the DOM unit and set up my files for the Dicee Challenge.

**Thoughts**: I feel like this unit went by fast, so it will be interesting to see how well I do on this upcoming challenge.
