# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some HTML review on my Udemy course (The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** This was admittedly a super easy day - I learned all this stuff a few months ago, but since I took a break for pretty much all of December, I decided it couldn't hurt to refresh on the basics. 


### Day 2: January 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked though more HTML review and installed some packages for Atom. 

**Thoughts**: More of the same today. I'm excited to play with these new packages, especially the atom-beautify one.


### Day 3: January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo! Continued working on HTML in my Udemy course. 

**Thoughts**: Github still isn't very intuitive for me, but I'm getting better with practice.
